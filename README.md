# Retro Funding Season 7 (S7) Data and Algorithms

## Quickstart

Clone the repo:

```bash
gh repo clone ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding
```

Navigate to the repo:

```bash
cd Retro-Funding
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
poetry env activate
```

Then, you can execute the commands below to test the simulation pipeline. For example:

```bash
python eval-algos/S7/utils/process_onchain_builders.py --measurement-period M4 --model onchain__goldilocks
```

## Simulation Pipeline

For each measurement period (e.g. M1, M2, etc.), the maintainers of this repository fetch a snapshot of the data, review the model weights, and run the scoring algorithm.

### Directory Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

```
Retro-Funding/
├── docs/
├── eval-algos/
│   └── S7/
│       ├── models/           # Core model implementations
│       ├── utils/            # Utility functions and scripts
└── results/
    └── S7/
        ├── M1/               # Measurement period
        |   ├── data/         # Input data
        |   ├── weights/      # Model configuration files
        |   └── outputs/      # Output results
        └── other_measurement_periods/
```

### Data Snapshots

We add raw data **snapshots** in the `data` directory associated with each measurement period. The following files are included for each measurement period:

- `onchain__project_metadata.csv`: Metadata about each project that applied to the Onchain Builders round.
- `onchain__metrics_by_project.csv`: Chain-level, month-by-month metrics about each project in the Onchain Builders round.
- `devtooling__project_metadata.csv`: Metadata about each project that applied to the Devtooling round.
- `devtooling__onchain_metadata.csv`: Metadata about each onchain project that was linked to a devtooling project.
- `devtooling__dependency_graph.csv`: A graph of the dependencies between devtooling and onchain projects.
- `devtooling__developer_graph.csv`: A graph of the developers who have committed code to onchain projects and engaged with devtooling projects.
- `devtooling__raw_metrics`: A summary of the raw (graph-level) metrics for each devtooling project, in JSON format.

Note that the `project_id` for each project is generated by OSO and is not the same as the `project_id` used by OP Atlas. To get the OP Atlas identifier for a project, query the `project_name` field in the `project_metadata` tables. The `display_name` is the name of the project as it will appear on OP Atlas's website.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The reason for using snapshots instead of live data is because the underlying mappings between projects and their artifacts (i.e., contracts, repos, packages, etc.) are continuously changing. Therefore, each snapshot represents the state of which projects are enrolled in the round, which artifacts are associated with those projects, and which metrics are publicly available about those artifacts.

You can also query Retro Funding data directly from OSO by following the guides [here](https://docs.opensource.observer/docs/contribute-models/retrofunding/s7-api-examples).

There are test datasets as well for testing the simulation pipeline.

### Fetching Data

To fetch the latest data for a specific measurement period, you need to:

1. Add your [OSO API key](https://docs.opensource.observer/docs/get-started/python) to a `.env` file in the root directory:
   
   ```
   OSO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. Run the fetch_data.py script with the desired measurement period. For example:
   ```bash
   python eval-algos/S7/utils/fetch_data.py --measurement-period M4
   ```

This will download the data from OSO and save it to the `results/S7/M4/data/` directory. The script will fetch all the necessary CSV files for both the onchain builders and devtooling rounds.

### Weights

The weights for each model are stored in the `results/S7/<measurement_period>/weights` directory.

Be sure to use the right data snapshot and simulation period for your simulation.

```yaml
data_snapshot:
  data_dir: 'results/S7/M4/data/'
  projects_file: 'onchain__project_metadata.csv'
  metrics_file: 'onchain__metrics_by_project.csv'

simulation:
  periods:
    previous: 'Apr 2025'
    current: 'May 2025'
```

You can also modify the weights for each model as you see fit. Note that new metrics may be added throughout the season. For example, the `onchain__metrics_by_project.csv` in M2 includes new metrics related to Worldchain activity.

```yaml
  metrics:
    amortized_contract_invocations_monthly: 0.25
    gas_fees_monthly: 0.25
    average_tvl_monthly: 0.25
    active_farcaster_users_monthly: 0.25
    
    qualified_addresses_monthly: 0.0
    active_addresses_monthly: 0.0
    contract_invocations_monthly: 0.0
  
  # Variant weights must sum to 1.0
  metric_variants:
    adoption: 0.20    # Current period value
    growth: 0.20      # Change from previous period
    retention: 0.60   # Minimum of current and previous
```

### Allocation Settings

Each model configuration file includes allocation settings that determine how funding is distributed:

```yaml
allocation:
  budget: 1333333.3333333333  # In OP tokens
  min_amount_per_project: 200 # In OP tokens
  max_share_per_project: 0.05 # Percentage of the total budget
```

These settings control:
- The total budget available for allocation
- The minimum amount each project can receive
- The maximum share of the budget any single project can receive

### Run the Pipeline

To run the simulation with a specific model and measurement period:

```bash
python eval-algos/S7/utils/process_onchain_builders.py --measurement-period M4 --model onchain__goldilocks
python eval-algos/S7/utils/process_devtools.py --measurement-period M4 --model devtooling__arcturus
```

This will:
1. Load the model configuration from `results/S7/M4/weights/<model>.yaml`
2. Process the data according to the model's algorithm
3. Save the results to `results/S7/M4/outputs/<model>_rewards.csv`

### Consolidating and Serializing Results

After running the simulation pipeline, you can consolidate and serialize the results using the following utilities:

#### Consolidating Rewards

The `consolidate_rewards.py` script combines all rewards files from a measurement period into a single CSV file:

```bash
python eval-algos/S7/utils/consolidate_rewards.py --measurement-period M4
```

This will:
1. Find all rewards CSV files in the `results/S7/M4/outputs/` directory
2. Standardize the format (ensuring consistent column names)
3. Add `round_id` ('7' for devtooling, '8' for onchain) and `filename` columns
4. Save the consolidated data to `results/S7/M4/outputs/M4_consolidated_rewards.csv`

#### Serializing Results

The `serialize.py` script creates JSON files that combine metrics and rewards data:

```bash
python eval-algos/S7/utils/serialize.py --measurement-period M4
```

This will:
1. Use the consolidated rewards file (or create it if it doesn't exist)
2. Create `devtooling__results.json` with devtooling metrics merged with round_id '7' rewards
3. Create `onchain__results.json` with onchain metrics merged with round_id '8' rewards

These JSON files are used for displaying results on OP Atlas and for further analysis.

## Model Details

### Onchain Builders

The Onchain Builders model analyzes and scores active Superchain projects based on their onchain activity. It processes raw metrics through a multi-step pipeline to produce normalized, weighted scores that reflect project performance across different chains and time periods.

<details>
<summary>Pipeline Steps</summary>

#### 1. Filter and Pivot Raw Metrics
- Takes raw metrics data with non-zero weights for specified measurement periods
- Pivots data by chain and metric to create a structured view
- Groups by `project_id`, `project_name`, `display_name`, and `chain`

#### 2. Sum and Weight by Chain
- Applies chain-specific weights (e.g., different weights for OP Mainnet vs other chains)
- Sums weighted metrics across all chains for each project
- Preserves project metadata in the aggregation

#### 3. Calculate Metric Variants
For each metric, computes three variants:
- **Adoption**: Current period value
- **Growth**: Positive difference between current and previous period values
- **Retention**: Minimum value between current and previous periods

#### 4. Normalize Metric Variants
- Applies min-max normalization to each metric variant
- Scales values to [0,1] range while preserving null values (e.g., TVL for non-DeFi projects)
- Optionally caps values at a specified percentile (e.g., 97th percentile)
- Uses fallback center value (0.5) when range is zero

#### 5. Apply Weights
- Multiplies each normalized metric variant by:
  - Its metric-specific weight
  - Its variant-specific weight (adoption/growth/retention)

#### 6. Aggregate Final Scores
- Combines weighted variants using power mean (p=2)
- Normalizes final scores to sum to 1.0

#### 7. Prepare Results
- Flattens multi-level columns for readability
- Merges intermediate results for transparency
- Sorts projects by final weighted score

### Devtooling OpenRank

The Devtooling model evaluates open-source developer tools by analyzing their relationships with onchain projects through package dependencies and developer contributions. It uses an EigenTrust-based algorithm released by OpenRank to propagate value through the graph.

<details>
<summary>Pipeline Steps</summary>

#### 1. Build Unweighted Graph
Constructs a directed graph with three types of edges:
- **Package Dependencies**: Onchain projects → Devtooling projects
- **Commit Events**: Onchain projects → Developers
- **GitHub Engagement**: Developers → Devtooling projects

Removes duplicate edges when an onchain project is also a devtooling project.

#### 2. Compute Onchain Project Pretrust
- Uses economic metrics from onchain projects
- Applies log transformation and min-max scaling
- Combines metrics using configured weights
- Normalizes scores to sum to 1.0

#### 3. Compute Devtooling Project Pretrust
- Uses GitHub metrics (num packages, stars, forks, etc.)
- Applies log transformation and min-max scaling
- Combines metrics using configured weights
- Normalizes scores to sum to 1.0

#### 4. Compute Developer Reputation
- Developers are pre-filtered to focus on active developers committing code to onchain project repos in Rust, Solidity, TypeScript, and Vyper
- Distributes onchain project pretrust to developers based on commit activity

#### 5. Weight Edges
Applies weights based on:
- Link type (package dependency, commit, GitHub engagement)
- Event type (NPM, CARGO, COMMIT_CODE)
- Time decay for non-static relationships
- More recent interactions contribute more weight in most cases

#### 6. Apply EigenTrust
- Combines pretrust scores from all sources
- Runs EigenTrust propagation on weighted graph
- Computes final trust scores for each node

#### 7. Rank and Evaluate Projects
- Ranks devtooling projects by final EigenTrust scores
- Applies eligibility criteria:
  - Minimum package dependency count
  - Minimum developer link count
- Normalizes scores among eligible projects

#### 8. Serialize Value Flow
- Uses iterative proportional fitting (IPF)
- Creates detailed value flow attribution
- Ensures contribution sums match:
  - Per devtool: Sum equals its overall score
  - Per onchain project: Sum equals its pretrust
